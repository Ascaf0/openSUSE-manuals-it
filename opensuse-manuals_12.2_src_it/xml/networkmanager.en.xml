 <para>
  &nm; is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. With
  &nm;, you do not need to worry about configuring network interfaces and
  switching between networks when you are moving.
 </para>

 <sect2 id="sec.basicnet.nm.comparison">
  <title>&nm; and ifup</title>
  <para>
   However, &nm; is not a suitable solution for all cases, so you can still
   choose between the traditional method for managing network connections
   (ifup) and &nm;. If you want to manage your network connection with &nm;,
   enable &nm; in the &yast; Network Settings module as described in
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/> and configure your network connections
   with &nm;. For a list of use cases and a detailed description how to
   configure and use &nm;, refer to <xref linkend="cha.nm"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some differences between ifup and &nm; include:

    <term>&rootuser; Privileges</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you use &nm; for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or
      start your network connection at any time from an icon within your desktop
      environment. &nm; also makes it possible to change and
      configure wireless card connections without requiring &rootuser;
      privileges. For this reason, &nm; is the ideal solution for a mobile
      workstation.
     </para>
     <para>
      Traditional configuration with ifup also provides some ways to switch,
      stop or start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires &rootuser;
      privileges to change or configure a network device. This is often a
      problem for mobile computing, where it is not possible to preconfigure
      all the connection possibilities.

    <term>Types of Network Connections</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Both traditional configuration and NetworkManager can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up, DSL and
      VPN. With NetworkManager you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G)
      modem, which is not possible with the traditional configuration.
     </para>
     <para>
      &nm; tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the best
      connection available. If the network cable is accidentally
      disconnected, it tries to reconnect. It can find the network with the
      best signal strength from the list of your wireless connections and
      automatically use it to connect. To get the same functionality with
      ifup, a great deal of configuration effort is required.

 <sect2 id="sec.basicnet.nm.functionality">
  <title>&nm; Functionality and Configuration Files</title>
  <para>
   The individual network connection settings created with &nm; are stored
   in configuration profiles. The <emphasis>system</emphasis> connections
   configured with either &nm; or &yast; are saved in
   <filename>/etc/networkmanager/system-connections/*</filename> or in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename>. Any user-defined
   connections are stored in GConf for GNOME. 
  </para>
  <para>
   In case no profile is configured, &nm; automatically creates one and
   names it <literal>Auto $INTERFACE-NAME</literal>. That is made in an
   attempt to work without any configuration for as many cases as (securely)
   possible. If the automatically created profiles do not suit your needs,
   use the network connection configuration dialogs provided by KDE or GNOME
   to modify them as desired. For more information, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.configure"/>.

  <title>Controlling and Locking Down &nm; Features</title>
  <para>
   On centrally administered machines, certain &nm; features can be
   controlled or disabled with &pk;, for example if a user is allowed to
   modify administrator defined connections or if a user is allowed to
   define his own network configurations. To view or change the respective
   &nm; policies, start the graphical <guimenu>Authorizations</guimenu> tool
   for &pk;. In the tree on the left side, find them below the
   <guimenu>network-manager-settings</guimenu> entry.
